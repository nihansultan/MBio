# Do you want to collaborate and share your ideas?

This website is an open platform for anyone who is willing to contribute. You can comment, share ideas and discuss. Here is the place for commenting about science. You can also contact me [contact me](mailto:mbiobiology@gmail.com) if you want to collaborate with me in the field of molecular biology (discus about papers, sharing your lab protocols, opening a question to think about a new project etc.) to improve this website.
