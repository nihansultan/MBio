Hybridization chain reaction (HCR)  has addressed challenges that impeded imaging of mRNA expression in diverse organisms, offering a unique combination of multiplexing, quantitation, sensitivity, resolution and versatility. With third-generation in situ HCR, we augment these capabilities using probes and amplifiers that combine to provide automatic background suppression throughout the protocol. We combine the benefits of a higher signal-to-background ratio with the convenience of using unoptimized probe sets for new targets and organisms.

In situ HCR v3.0 enables three multiplexed quantitative analysis modes. These include mRNA relative quantitation with subcellular resolution in the anatomical context of whole-mount vertebrate embryos.

1. qHCR imaging-analog mRNA relative quantitation in the anatomical sense of whole-mount vertebrate embryos with subcellular resolution
2. Analog mRNA relative quantitation of qHCR flow cytometry for high-throughput expression characterization of mammalian and bacterial cells
3. Digital mRNA absolute quantitation of dHCR imaging by single-molecule imaging in dense autofluorescent samples.

How does it work?
