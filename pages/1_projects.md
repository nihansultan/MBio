# All my projects

*I am working at Dr. Ab Matteen Rafiqi's Lab. Our researches are based on Ecological Evolutionary Developmental Biology (Eco-Evo-Devo). We are intrested in the origion of obligate endosymbiosis in the carpenter ants. Currently, I am working onthe establishment of the dorsaventral axis and the formation of extraembryonic membranes in carpenter ants. *

Ants within the distantly related order Hymenoptera on the other hand have highly restricted presence of endosymbionts. There are seventeen known ant subfamilies of which endosymbionts are present in only one subfamily, the Formicinae and within this family only in three tribes: Formicini, Plagiolepidini and Camponotini. There is an endosymbiotic relationship between these ants and three different types of bacteria that appear to have originated independent of each other. In case of Camponotini there is evidence of the presence of a single genus of bacteria called Blochmannia. While Blochmannia provides Camponotini ants with nutritional benefits, Camponotini provides Blochmannia with a special cellular environment for proliferation and vertical transmission to new generations. Therefore ants with restricted endosymbionts provide an excellent system to study the interaction between the endosymbionts and the developmental pathways of the host.
